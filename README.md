# 👋 Hey there, I'm Salwan!

Welcome to my corner of GitHub! I'm a **Computer Engineer** who loves building things — from low-level hardware systems to full-stack web apps and machine learning projects. Whether it's spinning up a new backend, wiring up a frontend, programming an FPGA, or training an ML model, I'm all in. I believe engineering is both an art and a superpower to solve real-world problems.
